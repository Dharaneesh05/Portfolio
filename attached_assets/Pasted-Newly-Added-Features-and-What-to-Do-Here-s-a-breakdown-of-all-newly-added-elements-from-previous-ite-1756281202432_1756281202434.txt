Newly Added Features and What to Do
Here's a breakdown of all newly added elements from previous iterations (e.g., orange-black color scheme, more animations, and refinements). These are integrated into the prompt above for completeness. Follow these steps to implement:

Color Scheme Changes (Orange-Black Theme):

What Was Added: Primary background changed to #000000 (pure black), accents to #FF4500 (orange) for buttons, highlights, borders, and gradients (e.g., in headings, buttons, borders).
What to Do: In your code, replace any gold/yellow references with orange (e.g., bg-orange-500 instead of bg-gold-500). Test in dark/light modes to ensure contrast (white text on black, black text on light). Use Tailwind's extend in tailwind.config.js for custom shades if needed.


More Animations:

What Was Added: Enhanced with bounce on icons (keyframe y-movement), pulse on stats/buttons (scale 1 to 1.05 loop), stagger for lists/grids (staggerChildren: 0.1), rotate-in for radar chart, shadow pulse on hover, and additional slide-ins/pulses throughout sections.
What to Do: Install Framer Motion if not already (npm install framer-motion). Wrap components in <motion.div> with variants (e.g., variants={{ hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 50 }, visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0 } }} initial="hidden" animate="visible"). Add keyframes in globals.css for pulse/bounce. Use whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }} for interactivity. Test on mobile to avoid performance issues—use reducedMotion for accessibility.


Responsive Enhancements:

What Was Added: Explicit responsive notes per section (e.g., stack on mobile, adjust columns/gaps with md:/lg:).
What to Do: Use Chrome DevTools to emulate devices. Add media queries if Tailwind breakpoints aren't enough. Ensure modals (e.g., resume/chat) use max-w-md on mobile and full-width on desktop.


Backend and Extras:

What Was Added: GitHub API helper in lib/github.js for activity feed (fetch recent commits in a subsection, e.g., under About or Projects).
What to Do: Create lib/github.js with a function like async function getGithubActivity() { return fetch('https://api.github.com/users/your-username/events').then(res => res.json()); }. Integrate in a component (e.g., Skills or Footer) with SWR for caching. Add env var for GitHub token if rate-limited.


Overall Implementation Steps:

Copy the prompt above and use it as a blueprint to code the site (or feed it to an AI code generator like Grok or Copilot).
Start with setup: Create repo, install deps, configure Tailwind/Next.js.
Build top-to-bottom: Navbar first, then Hero, etc.
Test: Run npm run dev, check animations/responsiveness, deploy to Vercel.
Customize: Replace placeholders (e.g., bio text, project details) with your real content. Upload resume.pdf to /public.
